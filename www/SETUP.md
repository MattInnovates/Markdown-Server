## Troubleshooting

**Server won't start?**
- Make sure Node.js is installed
- Check that port 3000 isn't already in use
- Try running on a different port: `PORT=8080 npm start`

**Files not showing up?**
- Make sure your `.md` files are in the same directory as `server.js`
- Refresh the browser page
- Check that files have the `.md` extension

**Styling looks broken?**
- Make sure the `public/style.css` file exists
- Check browser console for any error messages

## Customization

**Change the port:**
```bash
PORT=8080 npm start
```

**Modify styling:**
Edit `public/style.css` to customize the appearance

**Add features:**
The server code in `server.js` is well-commented and easy to extend
