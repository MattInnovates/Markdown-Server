### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your contribution is already being worked on
2. **Create an issue** for significant changes to discuss the approach
3. **Keep changes focused** - one feature or bug fix per pull request

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create a Branch

Create a descriptive branch name:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-syntax-highlighting
git checkout -b fix/markdown-parsing-bug
git checkout -b docs/update-readme
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clear, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

- Test the server with various markdown files
- Verify the UI works on different screen sizes
- Check that existing functionality still works

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add syntax highlighting for code blocks"
git commit -m "fix: resolve markdown table rendering issue"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub with:
- A clear title and description
- Reference to any related issues
- Screenshots for UI changes
- List of changes made

### 6. Code Review

- Be open to feedback and suggestions
- Respond promptly to review comments
- Make requested changes in additional commits
- Keep the conversation professional and constructive

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style

- Use **ES6+** features where appropriate
- Use **const** and **let** instead of **var**
- Use **semicolons** consistently
- Use **camelCase** for variables and functions
- Use **PascalCase** for classes and constructors

### Code Organization

- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Group related functionality together

### Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Recursively finds all markdown files in a directory
 * @param {string} dir - The directory path to search
 * @param {string[]} fileList - Array to store found files
 * @returns {string[]} Array of markdown file paths
 */
function findMarkdownFiles(dir, fileList = []) {
    const files = fs.readdirSync(dir);
    // Implementation...
}
```

### CSS/Styling

- Use **semantic class names**
- Follow **mobile-first** responsive design
- Maintain consistency with existing styles
- Use CSS custom properties for theming

## Testing

Currently, the project uses manual testing. When contributing:

1. **Test core functionality**:
   - Server starts correctly
   - Markdown files render properly
   - File browser navigation works
   - Responsive design functions

2. **Test edge cases**:
   - Empty directories
   - Large markdown files
   - Special characters in filenames
   - Different markdown syntax

3. **Cross-browser testing** (if making UI changes):
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - Mobile browsers
